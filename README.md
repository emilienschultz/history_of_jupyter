# History of Jupyter

This GitHub repository serves as a hub for gathering archives related to the Jupyter Project. Whether you're a researcher, developer or enthusiast, this space is dedicated to documenting and tracking progress on Jupyter-related facts and anecdotes.

*The main goal is to centralize scattered informations but also scientific publications either in social science of technology or computer science*

The first time I attempted to make an history of Jupyter was in 2014 during a scholarship in Berkeley, but without success. It's time to try again.

If you have relevant documents to contribute to the archive, don't hesitate to associate them. Every contribution, big or small, is appreciated and will be duly credited in publications.

If you have any question, feel free to contact me.
